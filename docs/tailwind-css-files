# Tailwind CSS files

All files under the `assets` folder are generated automatically.
When you will save `Pilo'Press > Styles > Tailwind` options in back-office, two files will be generated:
- `styles.css` file will take the content of the "Tailwind CSS" option.
- `tailwing.config.js` file will take the content of the "Tailwind Configuration" option.

If you click on "Update & Compile" and compile remotely thank to [TailwindAPI](https://www.tailwindapi.com/), `styles.min.css` and `styles-admin.min.css` files will be generated.

For more details, see [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/).
